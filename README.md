# Deployment Instructions

## ⚡ CloudShell Deploy (Simplest - Recommended)

**Deploy in just 3 commands using AWS CloudShell!** No local setup needed. See [CLOUDSHELL_DEPLOY.md](CLOUDSHELL_DEPLOY.md)

**Prerequisites:** Upload your documents to an S3 bucket first (via AWS Console).

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/ASUCICREPO/NCMW-Learning-Navigator-chatbot.git && cd NCMW-Learning-Navigator-chatbot && chmod +x *.sh

# 2. Configure (set your email and bucket)
export ADMIN_EMAIL="your-email@domain.com" && export S3_BUCKET="your-bucket-name" && \
sed -i "s/'national-council-s3-pdfs'/'${S3_BUCKET}'/g" cdk_backend/lib/cdk_backend-stack.ts && \
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/learning-navigator/admin-email" --value "$ADMIN_EMAIL" --type "String" --overwrite --region us-west-2

# 3. Deploy everything
./deploy-codebuild.sh
```

**Total Time:** ~25-30 minutes (automated)

## Usage

Once the infrastructure is deployed using either of the two approaches:

1. Upload any PDF files to the S3 Bucket (national-council-s3-pdfs)

2. Sync the Knowledge Base:
   - Go to AWS Console > Bedrock > Knowledge bases
   - Select the knowledge base created by the stack
   - Click the "Sync data sources" button
   - Wait for sync to complete (status will show "Available")

3. SES Email Verification (Post-Deployment)
   - An email will be sent from AWS to the provided admin email address for verification.
   - If you can't find the email, check the Spam folder and verify by clicking the given link.

5. Add User in Cognito (Post-Deployment)

    - AWS Console → Cognito → **User Pools** → `YOUR_USER_POOL_ID`
    - Select **Users and groups** → **Create user**
    - Fill in **Username**, **Temporary password**, and required attributes (e.g., email)
    - Click **Create user** (the user will reset their password on first login)

6. Deploy the Frontend:
   - Go to AWS Console > AWS Amplify
   - Select the app created by the stack
   - Access the application URL provided by Amplify

7. Using the Application:
   - Once frontend deployment is complete, navigate to the Amplify URL
   - The chat interface will load with example queries about MHFA training and resources
   - **No login required** - Chat works immediately in guest mode
   - Click the **Profile icon** to select your role and view personalized recommendations
   - Use the **Language toggle** button to switch between English and Spanish

- **4 evaluation factors**: Relevance (30%), Completeness (30%), Clarity (20%), Actionability (20%)
- **Score ranges**: 0-100 with categorical ratings (Excellent, Good, Acceptable, etc.)
- **Admin dashboard** displays sentiment trends and low-score conversations
- Powered by Amazon Bedrock (Nova Lite model)

### Admin Portal Features
Secure administrative dashboard (requires Cognito authentication):
- **Document Management** - Upload and manage knowledge base PDFs
- **Analytics Dashboard** - View chat metrics and sentiment analysis
- **Escalated Queries** - Manage questions requiring human expert attention
- **Conversation Logs** - Review detailed chat transcripts with sentiment scores
- **Email Notifications** - Automated alerts via Amazon SES

For a complete list of admin features, see [Admin Portal Features Summary](docs/ADMIN_PORTAL_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md).

### Troubleshooting
1. WebSocket Connection Issues
- Error: "WebSocket connection failed"
  - Check if the AWS API Gateway WebSocket API is deployed correctly
  - Verify the WebSocket URL in the frontend environment variables
  - Ensure your AWS credentials have appropriate permissions

2. Lambda Function Errors
- Error: "Lambda function timed out"
  - Check CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
  - Increase the Lambda function timeout in the CDK stack
  - Verify memory allocation is sufficient

3. AI Response Issues
- Error: "Knowledge base not responding"
  - Verify the Bedrock knowledge base is properly configured
  - Check if the S3 bucket contains the required MHFA data files
  - Ensure the Lambda function has proper IAM permissions

## Data Flow
The application processes user queries through a multi-stage pipeline that ensures accurate and contextual responses.

```ascii
User Query → WebSocket API → Lambda → Bedrock Agent → Knowledge Base
     ↑                                     ↓
     └──────────── Response ←─────── Email Notification
```

Component interactions:
1. User submits query through WebSocket connection
2. Lambda function processes request and invokes Bedrock Agent
3. Agent queries knowledge base and evaluates confidence
4. High confidence responses (>90%) are returned directly with citations
5. Low confidence queries trigger admin notification workflow
6. Session logs are stored in DynamoDB for analytics
7. File uploads are processed and ingested into knowledge base

## Infrastructure

![Infrastructure diagram](./docs/infra.jpg)

### Architecture Diagram Explanation

- **User → Amplify Front-End**
  - **1.1** User submits question and later their email if needed.
  - **1.9** Amplify returns the Bedrock agent's answer or asks for the email when escalation is needed.

- **Amplify → Amazon API Gateway**
  - **1.2** API Gateway receives the request from Amplify and acts as the single entry point for back-end services.

- **API Gateway → Amazon Bedrock Agent**
  - **1.3** Gateway forwards the query to the Bedrock Agent.
  - **1.4** Agent inspects the query and decides whether it can answer directly from its **Bedrock Knowledge Base**.

- **Bedrock Agent ↔ Knowledge Base (S3 Data Source)**
  - A **sync-up workflow** keeps reference docs in an **S3 bucket** synchronized with the Knowledge Base.
  - **1.6** Agent retrieves the answer and returns it to API Gateway (**1.7**), which then responds to Amplify (**1.8**).

- **Human-in-the-Loop Escalation via Amazon SES**
  - **3.2** If the Agent cannot answer, API Gateway uses **Amazon SES** to email the question (and the user's email) to an **Admin**.
  - **3.3** Admin receives the email.
  - **4.1 / 4.2** Admin replies to the user *and* the bot.
  - **5** Admin's answer is indexed—written to S3 and ingested into the Knowledge Base, improving future responses.

- **Admin Authentication & Document Management**
  - **6.1 / 7.1** Admin authenticates through **Amazon Cognito** and accesses an Amplify-hosted portal.
  - **6.3** Within the portal, the Admin uploads or edits docs in the S3 data source feeding the Knowledge Base.

- **Observability & Analytics Pipeline**
  - **DynamoDB** stores structured logs/metrics from the Bedrock Agent; raw logs are archived in **S3**.
  - A lightweight **LLM process** mines those S3 logs for insights.
  - **Dashboard (7.3)** pulls aggregated data from DynamoDB to provide real-time analytics.
  - **CloudWatch** captures infrastructure-level logs across the entire stack.

- **Data-Flow Summary**
  1. **Primary path:** *User → Amplify → API Gateway → Bedrock Agent → Knowledge Base/S3 → User*
  2. **Escalation path:** *API Gateway → SES → Admin → SES → Knowledge Base/S3*
  3. **Admin management:** *Cognito-authenticated Amplify app → S3 (documents) + DynamoDB/S3 (logs) → Dashboard*

> This architecture combines a serverless web front-end, a Bedrock-powered retrieval agent, human-in-the-loop escalation, and a full observability layer—yielding immediate answers for users while letting admins curate content and monitor system health in one cohesive workflow.
