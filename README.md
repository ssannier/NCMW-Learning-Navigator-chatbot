The application implements a serverless architecture on AWS, combining:

- **Frontend**: React application hosted on AWS Amplify
- **Backend**: AWS CDK-deployed infrastructure with API Gateway and Lambda
- **AI Layer**: AWS Bedrock Agent with Knowledge Base for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Data Storage**: S3 for documents, DynamoDB for conversation history, OpenSearch Serverless for vectors
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito for admin dashboard access
- **Email**: Amazon SES for admin notifications and escalation workflow

For a detailed deep dive into the architecture, see [docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md).

- **Advanced AI**: Claude 4 Sonnet with cross-region inference profile
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional chat
- **Secure Authentication**: Amazon Cognito with JWT tokens

## Data Flow

### User Interaction

1. User sends question through React frontend via WebSocket
2. API Gateway routes request to WebSocket Handler Lambda
3. Lambda invokes Bedrock Agent with user query
4. Agent queries Knowledge Base for relevant information
5. OpenSearch performs semantic vector search on embeddings
6. Agent generates contextual response using Claude 4 Sonnet
7. Response with citations is returned to user in real-time

### Admin Workflow

1. Low-confidence queries trigger email escalation
2. Admin receives notification via Amazon SES
3. Admin responds with accurate information
4. Response is stored in S3 and ingested into Knowledge Base
5. Future similar queries receive improved answers
